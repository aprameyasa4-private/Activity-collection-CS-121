# Part 1 : To be done before you start your project

## Program Overview

1. In your own words, explain the purpose of this program in at most
   three sentences.  (What does it do? What input will it need? What
   output does it produce?)


2. List each source file (.java) in the project and explain its
   purpose.  You don't have to use complete sentences.



# Concept References

Identify the slides (module and slide numbers) that introduce and
demonstrate each of the following concepts:

* Encapsulation
* Instance Variables
* Getters/Setters
* ArrayLists
* Interfaces
* Reading files
* Writing files
* Writing vs. appending to files
* Purpose of constructor
* Exception handling
* Aggregation
* Tokenizing Strings/Handling CSV data




# Activity Connections

This project requires writing different classes for specific jobs in
the project and getting them all to interact correctly.  You will also
need to frequently read and write files.

Reflecting on the Task activity and ToDoList activities, answer the following questions:

* Why did you need getters and setters in your classes?  What access
  modifier should be used for instance variables?  What access
  modifier should be used for methods that other classes need to call?



* What is the relationship between Task and ToDoList (using the class
  relationships defined in part 5 of module 6 slides)?



* How did you find specific Tasks in the ToDoList?  How can you find
  specific Posts in the Textbook?



* How were Interfaces used in the activities?  What is the purpose of
  the Interfaces provided in this project?



* In ToDoList, one constructor took a File object. How is this
  constructor similar to the TextBook constructor?  How can the file
  be used to populate the Textbook (think how it was used to populate
  the ToDoList)?



# Testing Plan

How will you test this program during development to ensure it meets
all requirements? How will you know your program has met all
requirements?



# Compile and Run Instructions

* From the directory containing all source code (.java) files, what is the command-line command that compiles the program?


* From the directory containing the compiled class (.class) files, what is the command-line command that runs the program?


* Provide any additional instructions the user needs beyond the run command to run the program.



# Part 2: To be done after your program is done

## Sources

List all outside sources (with specific links) you used to help you on
this project.  You do not need to list slides, the book, or other
class assignments.



## Reflection

1. Discuss one bug you encountered while programming.  How did you
   find the bug?  What process did you use to fix the bug?  What did
   you learn from this bug that might help you in the future?



2. Provide a two to three paragraph reflection on this project.
   Discuss things like the challenges you had, resources you used,
   strategies you found helpful or not helpful, etc.
