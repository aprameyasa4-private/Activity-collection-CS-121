# Module 2 Activity - Temperature Conversion

## Purpose & Concepts
The purpose of this activity is to practice previously covered concepts and the following new concepts: Primitive data types, Expressions, Modulo, Widening/Narrowing conversions, Automatic assignment conversion, Casting, Promotion

## Problem Description
In this activity you will create a new class called TemperatureConversion.java that will prompt the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit, calculate the corresponding temperature and display it in a meaningful way to the user. You will clone the example repository to help you in this.
 
## Requirements
1. Store the temperature in Fahrenheit in a variable. You will convert this value.
2. Use mathematical expressions to convert the Fahrenheit value to Celsius. Store this in another variable.
3. Display the converted temperature in a meaningful way. (e.g. "75 degrees Fahrenheit is equivalent to 23.9 in Celsius")

## Before You Begin: Computational Thinking & Planning
1. Open a new window of Visual Studio Code
2. Choose `Clone Git Repository` from the welcome page
3. Enter the following url where prompted: `https://github.com/BoiseState/CS121-Public-F22.git` 
4. Store the repository in your cs121 directory.
5. Look through the repository to see what sorts of examples are available.
6. Outline the steps you need to take in your main method (described below).  Be sure to note what variables and what types you need at each step.

## To Do
1. Expand the folder named a2.1-TemperatureConversion and create a file TemperatureConversion.java
1. Open another Visual Studio Code window, open the example repository, and read `CS121-Public-FA22/examples/Module2/TempConverter.java`. TempConverter.java converts a given Celsius temperature to the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Opening another Visual Studio Code window allows you to reference this program while writing your code.
1. Using the steps you created in line comments, write TemperatureConversion.java to fulfill the given requirements.  

## Review & Reflect
1. Terminology Identification: Identify examples of at least 3 different concepts listed in the "Concepts" list above. These should be identified with an @keyterm tag within the comment.
2. Code Review: When you are finished with this activity, pair up with a classmate and review each other’s code to make sure it meets all the requirements. 
3. Reflection: At the end of REFLECTION.md write a one paragraph reflection describing your experience with this activity. What went well? What was challenging? How could you improve your plan prior to beginning to code? 

## Finally
1. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 2.1 is complete.
2. Push the changes from your local repository to the GitHub classroom repository.
