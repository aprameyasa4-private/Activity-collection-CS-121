# Part 1: To be done before you start your project

## Program Overview

1. In your own words, explain the purpose of this program in at most
   three sentences.  (What does it do? What input will it need? What
   output does it produce?)


2. List each source file (.java file) in the project and explain its
   purpose.  You don't have to use complete sentences.



# Concept References

Identify the slides (module and slide numbers) that introduce and demonstrate each of the following concepts:
 * declaring, initializing, and accessing variables
 * declaring, initializing, and accessing constants
 * arithmetic expressions for calculating new values
 * declaring and referencing Colors
 * Graphics drawing methods

# Activity Connections

* Scaling dimensions of Graphics shapes using multiples (or fractions)
  of a unit dimension calculated based on current window size is a
  central concept of this project. Give examples from the MiniFig and
  Geocentric Orbit activities where you scaled something based on
  another "unit dimension" based on the current window size.



* Positioning Graphics shapes relative to calculated "anchor points",
  based either on a current window dimension or another
  already-established point in the window is a central concept of this
  project. Give examples from the MiniFig and Geocentric Orbit
  activities where you calculated the location of one shape based on
  another calculated location. How did the dimensions of the shape
  being drawn play into the calculations of its position?




# Testing Plan

How will you test this program during development to ensure it meets
all requirements? How will you know your program has met all
requirements?



# Compile and Run Instructions

* From the directory containing all source code (.java) files, what is the command-line command that compiles the program?


* From the directory containing the compiled class (.class) files, what is the command-line command that runs the program?


* Provide any additional instructions the user needs beyond the run command to run the program.



# Part 2: To be done after your program is done

## Sources

List all outside sources (with specific links) you used to help you on
this project.  You do not need to list slides, the book, or other
class assignments.



## Reflection

1. Discuss one bug you encountered while programming.  How did you
   find the bug?  What process did you use to fix the bug?  What did
   you learn from this bug that might help you in the future?



2. Provide a two to three paragraph reflection on this project.
   Discuss things like the challenges you had, resources you used,
   strategies you found helpful or not helpful, etc.
