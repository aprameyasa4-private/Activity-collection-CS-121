## Reflection

Write a one paragraph reflection describing your experience with this
activity. What went well? What was challenging? How could you improve 
your plan prior to beginning to code?

First, when I read through the README.md File, i was totally confused and did not know what to do or even how to do. 
Copying  my old files from the Previous activity to this one added to this chaos as i did not knnow or understand what to remove from the old files, specifically the Driver class File, TaskMaster.java I had to delete everything and start from scratch using the given Interface and the requirements from the README file. I then tested the Class files, specifically the ToDoList file and then worked on the Driver class requirements of adding 3 tasks to the collection and then printing them out, getting the next word, etc.
