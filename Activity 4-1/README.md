# Module 4 Week 1 Activity - Bouncy Ball (two class periods)

## Purpose & Concepts 
The purpose of this activity is to practice using previous concepts and the following new concepts: Conditional, Relational operators, Equality, Comparisons, Logical operators, Truth table, if Statements, if-else Statements, Nested statements

## Problem Description
In this activity, you will create an animation that paints a colored ball, bouncing around within the confines of the window. You can watch this [Bouncy Ball YouTube video](https://youtu.be/W6kMTgAOx8E) to see a demonstration of the expected behavior.

## Requirements
You are to modify BouncyBall.java at the TODO statements in the `paintComponent()` method to:
1. Add conditional statements to keep the ball in bounds in the x-axis (e.g. the left and right edges).
2. Add conditional statements to keep the ball in bounds in the y-axis (e.g. the top and bottom edges)
3. Be sure the ball stays in bounds even when the window is resized.
4. After the above is working correctly add some or all of the following features:
   - Randomly determine the starting color of the ball. Look for the TODO comments in the BouncyBall() constructor method.
   - Randomly determine the starting coordinates for the ball. Look for the TODO comments in the BouncyBall() constructor method.
   - Can you make the ball size change while it moves?
 

## Before You Begin: Computational Thinking & Planning
1. Read **BouncyBall.java** to understand how the methods work together, what information you have to work with, and how your code will fit into the overall framework given.
2. Refer to this [handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZ23IPyQqZcyiHNwAobW2EHzVAqe_15BVSryeLYyE0c/) to help with your planning.
3. Add extra algorithm comments in BouncyBall.java. Be sure to note what information you need for each conditional statement, what each piece of the conditional is checking for, and what should happen if the condition is true. Think about the possible scenarios you should test.


## To Do
1. Expand the folder named a4.1-BouncyBall and open the file named BouncyBall.java
1. Modify BouncyBall.java to satisfy each of the requirements.
1. **After** the above is working correctly, add one or more of the additional features described in the requirements section. 

## Review & Reflect
1. Terminology Identification: Identify examples of at least 4 different concepts listed in the "Concepts" list above. These should be identified with an @keyterm tag within the comment.
2. Code Review: When you are finished with this activity, pair up with a classmate and review each other’s code to make sure it meets all the requirements.
3. Reflection: At the end of REFLECTION.md write a one paragraph reflection describing your experience with this activity. What went well? What was challenging? How could you improve your plan prior to beginning to code? 

## Finally
1. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that Activity 4.1 is complete.
2. Push the changes from your local repository to the GitHub classroom repository.
