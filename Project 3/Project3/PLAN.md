# Part 1: To be done before you start your project

## Program Overview

1. In your own words, explain the purpose of this program in at most

   output does it produce?)


2. List each source file (.java) in the project and explain its
   purpose.  You don't have to use complete sentences.

# Activity Connections

This project is similar to the LiteBrite activity.  Both require you
to create a GUI, align elements, and react to button presses.

Reflecting on the LiteBrite activity, answer the following questions:

* How did you register an ActionListener on your LiteBrite buttons?
  How will you register an ActionListener on your TicTacToe gameboard
  and what will it need to do?

* How did you know which button was clicked in your ActionListener?

* How did you set the text of the Reset button? How will you update
  the text parts of the TicTacToe GUI?

* What did you need to do to reset the LiteBrite board?  What will you
  need to do to reset the TicTacToe board?


# Testing Plan

How will you test this program during development to ensure it meets
all requirements? How will you know your program has met all
requirements?


# Compile and Run Instructions

* From the directory containing all source code (.java) files, what is the command-line command that compiles the program?


* From the directory containing the compiled class (.class) files, what is the command-line command that runs the program?


* Provide any additional instructions the user needs beyond the run command to run the program.



# Part 2: To be done after your program is done

## Sources

List all outside sources (with specific links) you used to help you on
this project.  You do not need to list slides, the book, or other
class assignments.



## Reflection

1. Discuss one bug you encountered while programming.  How did you
   find the bug?  What process did you use to fix the bug?  What did
   you learn from this bug that might help you in the future?



2. Provide a two to three paragraph reflection on this project.
   Discuss things like the challenges you had, resources you used,
   strategies you found helpful or not helpful, etc.
