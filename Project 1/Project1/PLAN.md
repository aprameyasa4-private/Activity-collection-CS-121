# Part 1 : To be done before you start your project

## Program Overview

1. In your own words, explain the purpose of this program in at most
   three sentences.  (What does it do? What input will it need? What
   output does it produce?)


2. List each source file (.java) in the project and explain its
   purpose.  You don't have to use complete sentences.



# Concept References

Identify the slides (module and slide numbers) that introduce and demonstrate each of the following concepts:
 * sentinel values for loops
 * switch statements
 * correcting text input for case - multiple cases or using String case methods
 * ArrayLists
 * using a class (like Track) - calling the constructor, methods
 * using a Scanner to read keyboard input
 * using a Scanner to read lines from files
 * using a Scanner to break a String into tokens
 * looping through lists - accessing current object


# Activity Connections

* Consider the AdGenerator activity. You had to read in various data
  types, including mixing String and numeric data.  How did you read
  in numeric input without compromising the next input?



* Loops are needed throughout this project for the menu, loading
  playlists, searching for keyterms, and analyizing a playlist. What
  kinds of loops were used in the GameBoard activity? Can the type of
  loop you used in GradeBook be used for all purposes in this project,
  or will you need other types of loops as well?



* There is a great deal of overlap between this project and the
  GradeBook activity.  The GradeBook activity demonstrated reading a
  file, tokenizing the data, creating objects from the data, and
  populating an ArrayList.  Write a pseudo-code algorithm (e.g. use
  English, not code) that outlines the steps to read a file and
  tokenize the data. (Use your GradeBook activity to help you).
 





# Testing Plan

How will you test this program during development to ensure it meets
all requirements? How will you know your program has met all
requirements?



# Compile and Run Instructions

* From the directory containing all source code (.java) files, what is the command-line command that compiles the program?


* From the directory containing the compiled class (.class) files, what is the command-line command that runs the program?


* Provide any additional instructions the user needs beyond the run command to run the program.



# Part 2: To be done after your program is done

## Sources

List all outside sources (with specific links) you used to help you on
this project.  You do not need to list slides, the book, or other
class assignments.



## Reflection

1. Discuss one bug you encountered while programming.  How did you
   find the bug?  What process did you use to fix the bug?  What did
   you learn from this bug that might help you in the future?



2. Provide a two to three paragraph reflection on this project.
   Discuss things like the challenges you had, resources you used,
   strategies you found helpful or not helpful, etc.
